# External: dune (OCaml verifier)

## One-liner

v0's only live verifier. Runs `dune build @runtest` (and `@check` when only typechecking is needed) on the target program; parses the test output to map `P<id>_*` test names to property statuses.

## Scope

What k4k actually expects from dune at runtime, not a re-statement of the dune docs. Captures observed quirks — exit-code interpretation, test-runner stdout shape, error-vs-failure distinction.

## Invocation surface

```
dune build @check                              # typecheck-only (used during patch screening)
dune build @runtest                            # build + run all tests (the property check)
dune build @runtest --force                    # invalidate cache (used after every patch)
```

For v0, k4k always uses:
- `--force` on `@runtest` after applying a patch (cache invalidation safety).
- `--display=quiet` to keep stdout machine-parseable (no progress prose).
- `--root <workdir>` to pin the build root.

## Process model

- One subprocess per verifier invocation.
- Startup cost: small (~50-200 ms cold, less if warm).
- k4k consumes stdout + stderr + exit code. No streaming.

## Test-name convention (k4k-specific contract)

Every test must be named `P<id>_<slug>` where `<id>` matches the property ID exactly (e.g. `P3a4b1c2_argv_handles_missing_required`). The verifier adapter:
1. Parses dune's test output (alcotest format expected; framework-specific adapters TBD).
2. For each test result line, extracts `P<id>` and the pass/fail status.
3. Maps to `Established | Contradicted | Unknown` per property.

Tests not matching the convention are surfaced as `verifier.warning` events (`T20`) but do not break the build.

## Output parsing

Default test framework: alcotest. Its output looks like:
```
Testing `myproject'.
This run has ID `XXXXXXXX'.
  [OK]          Suite        0   P3a4b1_argv_handles_missing_required.
  [FAIL]        Suite        1   P5e6f7_stdout_is_utf8.
...
The full test results are available in `_build/default/_tests/...`
```

The adapter parses lines matching `^\s*\[(OK|FAIL)\]\s+\S+\s+\d+\s+(P\w+)_.*\.\s*$` and:
- `[OK]` → `Established`
- `[FAIL]` → `Contradicted`
- Property in `D` not seen in output → `Unknown`

Other test frameworks (ounit2, qcheck, …) are out of scope for v0.

## Exit-code semantics

| `dune` exit | Interpretation                                                 | k4k mapping                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0           | Build OK + all tests pass                                      | All listed properties → `Established` |
| 1           | Build OK + one or more tests failed                            | Per-property mapping from output |
| 1           | Build error (typecheck failure, missing dep)                   | `EVERIFIER_TOOL_ERROR` (parse stderr to confirm) |
| 2           | Internal dune error                                            | `EVERIFIER_TOOL_ERROR`       |
| 130         | Killed (e.g. SIGINT propagated)                                | Treat as `Tool_error` w/ "interrupted" |

The "1 means build error vs test fail" ambiguity is resolved by the parser: if no `[OK]/[FAIL]` lines appear at all, treat as build error.

## Request budget

dune itself has no cost; constraint is wall-clock. v0 budget:
- `dune build @check`: assume ≤ 5 s for a small project.
- `dune build @runtest --force`: assume ≤ 30 s for a small project.

A wall-clock cap (60 s default, configurable) is enforced via process timeout; on expiry, kill child and emit `EVERIFIER_TOOL_ERROR`.

## Failure modes

| Failure                                  | Detection                                | k4k action                                  |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `dune` not on `$PATH`                    | execvp ENOENT                            | `EVERIFIER_UNAVAILABLE`, exit 2             |
| OCaml compiler missing                   | dune stderr has "no installed compiler" | `EVERIFIER_UNAVAILABLE`, exit 2             |
| dune-project absent                      | dune stderr has "no dune-project file"   | `EVERIFIER_TOOL_ERROR`, exit 2              |
| Build error in newly applied patch       | Exit 1 + no `[OK]/[FAIL]` lines          | Reject the patch in `Gap_step`              |
| Hung test                                | Wall-clock > 60 s                        | Kill child; treat as `Contradicted` for the focus property |

## Determinism

dune builds are deterministic given a clean working tree. k4k enforces clean state by running on a scratch branch and using `--force`. Two consecutive runs on the same source must produce the same `result` — verified by the test suite's `NF6_determinism_under_repeat`.

## Side effects

- `_build/` is created in the workdir. k4k does **not** treat `_build/` as user-owned; it may be wiped freely.
- No global state mutations (provided opam env is configured per-user, not system-wide).

## Versioning

`dune --version` recorded in `manifest.verifier.version`. Major-version changes warrant a JSONL warning but do not invalidate state by themselves.

## Agent notes

> **The test-name convention is the wire contract** between k4k and dune. If a contributor uses `let%test "..."` (no name) or names a test in some other style, the verifier adapter cannot map it to a property — and the gap-step will mark the property `Contradicted` for the wrong reason. Lint check on the agent prompts: must instruct `P<id>_<slug>` discipline.
>
> **Don't add framework breadth in v0.** If a target program needs ounit2 or qcheck for some reason, declare that out of scope and revisit in v1. The point of v0 is one tight loop end-to-end.
